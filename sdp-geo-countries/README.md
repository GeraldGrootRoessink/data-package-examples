Countries in GeoJSON format.

An implementation of the simple vector data proposal made in [Spatial Data Package Investigation](https://research.okfn.org/spatial-data-package-investigation/#line-and-polygon-) with  [`spatial-profile`](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/geo-data-package/6143/26?u=stephen) applied at the resource level.

## Data

This GeoJSON file contains for each country:

- the `geometry` of polygon that provides the rough outline of the country
- an `ADMIN` property that is the common name of the country
- the `ISO_A3` property that is a 3 character code for the country, according to [ISO3166 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
