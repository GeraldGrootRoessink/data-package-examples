Country Population referencing unofficial boundaries using GeoJSON

An attempted implementation of the boundary-linked data linking to unofficial boundaries proposal made in [Spatial Data Package Investigation](https://research.okfn.org/spatial-data-package-investigation/#preparing-boundary-linked-tabular-data) with exceptions:

-  [`spatial-profile`](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/geo-data-package/6143/26?u=stephen) applied at the resource level.
-  There is no `spatial-profile` for `boundary-id` data. Added `"spatial-profile": "boundary-id"` so the data resource can be discovered as one containing location information
